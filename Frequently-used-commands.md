## Running a node

To start up the Edgeware node and connect to testnet 0.9.0, run:
```
./target/release/edgeware --chain=chains/testnet-0.9.0.json --name <INSERT_NAME>
```

To run a chain locally for development purposes:
```
./target/release/edgeware --chain=local --alice --validator
```

To allow apps in your browser to connect, as well as anyone else on your local network, add the `--rpc-cors=all` flag.

To force your local to create new blocks, even if offline, add the `--force-authoring` flag.

## Generating keypairs

To create a keypair, install subkey with `cargo install --force --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate subkey`. Then run the following:
```
subkey generate
```
To create an ED25519 keypair, run the following:
```
subkey -e generate
```
To create derived keypairs, use the mnemonic generated from a method above and run (use `-e` for ED25519):
```
subkey inspect "<mnemonic>"//<derive_path>
```
For example:
```
subkey inspect "west paper guide park design weekend radar chaos space giggle execute canoe"//edgewarerocks
```

## Public nodes
